# CSE308-Project-3
Parse the distance matrix for processing (5%)
Compute a UPGMA tree from the input data (40%)
specify pairs of nodes and their heights:
(a, (b,c, .5), .9)
Compute a Neighbor Joining tree from the input data (40%)
specify distances between pairs of artificial and concrete nodes
A, U1, 4
B, U1, 6
U1, U2, 2
U2, C 5
note: consult nevvick format to understand tree distances generated by Phylip
Output a text illustration of the updated tree (15%)
The text illustration should be a topological representation of the treeâ€™s layout, and the edge lengths do not need to be represented.
